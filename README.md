# Reaction Time Game

Developed with Qt Creator, the goal of this game is to press the key corresponding to the color of the circle as fast as possible. The circle colors correspond to the arrow keys: yellow for up, green for down, blue for left, and red for right. When the player presses the key corresponding to the circle color, a new circle is generated at a random position in the window with a randomly chosen color. The number of hits, misses, and reaction time are recorded and displayed on the user interface. Additionally, the game can be reset by clicking on the "Reset" button.
